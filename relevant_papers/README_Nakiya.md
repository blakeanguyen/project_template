ATTITUDES TOWARD UNRELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC AIDING IN DANGEROUS TASK ENVIRONMENTS Faerevaag, C. L., Nguyen, B. A., Jimenez, C. A., & Jentsch, F. University of Central Florida

## Review

Summary: The paper looks at using automation to help increase SA in benign and dangerous environments. To increase SA, a method of automation called diagnostic aiding was introduced because of its ability to influence information acquisition and information analysis. Along with SA, the reliability of the automated device was investigated to understand in what situations did users find the automation helpful, regardless of reliability levels. In conclusion, it was found that users would rather use automation with a low reliability in dangerous environments because help from the automation potentially provides an opportunity for solution than no help at all.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The clarity of this paper is well written and easy to follow along. Different topics and concepts are introduced in the beginning of the article but later explained in great detail.

#### Quality of References
The quality of references is a well diverse mix. The references topics range from HRI, reliability, trust, automation, situation awareness, and Human Factor topic.

#### Reproducibility
I believe this paper is very reproduceable. The methods used in this paper can be followed and recreated for each section. This paper also allows for the ability to reconstruct or redesign some of the steps involved in this paper.

#### Rating
4 out of 5. 
(1-5)
(1 awful)
(5 best thing you ever read)

#### Explanation of Rating
This paper provides a different perspective to how automation can be used and I believe the use of diagnostic aiding paired with SA  (for this paper/topic) is only the beginning of how the combination can be used to overall enhance HRI situations.
