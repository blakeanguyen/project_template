## Review

Attitudes towards unreliable diagnostic aiding automation in dangerous task environments

Faerevaag, C. L., Nguyen, B. A., Jimenez, C. A., Jentsch, F. (2017). Attitudes toward unreliable diagnostic aiding in dangerous task environments. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (Vol. 61). Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications.

Summary:
This research article was interesed in investigating the attitudes toward unreliable and reliable diagnostic aiding automation in safe and hostile enviroments. Participants in this study were asked to complete a questionnaire that was developed by the first author. The results indicated that even when automation was deemed 50% reliable it was still viewed as reliable/useful.

Executive summary:
Overall, this article provides the inital framework for future studies. This article investigated the reliability threshold that has been previous researched and furhter advanced the studies in the area of human-robot teams with the mindset that future teams will consist of a robotic teammate. The limitations in this study provide a framework that can be reproducibility with consideration to altering a few variables in the study design.


#### Clarity of Exposition
Overall, the clairity of the paper is sound. The paper provides the motivations behind why this particular area of research is important as well as provided a clear explanaiton for the current study objectives and how the study was developed.

#### Quality of References
The quality of the references are concrete as the researchers provided founding researchers of the reliability threshold.

#### Reproducibility
I believe this research study is highly reproducable as it provides a framework for the research. The future directions of this area of research are clearly defined and provides readers with limitations of the study as background for future research study designs and intents.

#### Rating
4 out of 5.
(1-5)
(1 awful)
(5 best thing you ever read)

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave this article a 4 out of 5 because it does provide the foundation of future directions, the data collected in this study are from the general university population and I feel that providing more explicit participants such as SMEs may provide more meaningful data and information regarding human-robot teams and reliability perceptions.
