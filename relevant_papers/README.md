## Review

Field Assessment of Multimodal Communication for Dismounted Human-Robot Teams

Summarize/Describe the paper: This research experiment supported bi-directional communication between a dismounted Soldier and a robotic teammate with the use of a multimodal interface. The multimodal interface (MMI) capabilities such as auditory and visual communication was assessed. The results in this research experiment helped inform the established recommendations for multimodal interface designs regarding the usability and functionality of the multimodal interface. This paper contributed to research areas regarding human-robot interaction. 

Executive summary of your whole review: Overall, this research study provides a better understanding of the goals of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory in regards to Human-Robot teams. This research also provides the motivations toward transitioning robotics from tools to teammates and the benefits of making this transition in human-robot teams. I believe this research study provides a good foundation for our current research project as it provides example recommendations for improving multimodal communication and multimodal interfaces. I would have liked to see example questions from the two questionnaires used in this research study to gain a better understanding of the positive and negative aspects of the MMI. 

#### Clarity of Exposition
This research study builds upon previous work in relation to developing communication interfaces that reflect the methods that humans use to communicate with one another. The authors also referred to a paradigm shift that is associated with human-robot teams communication technology through various modalities to aid in the issues related to cognitive workloads. 

#### Quality of References
The authors references well-known names in the research industry for example, Nielsen’s (1993) research article that addresses the usability of an interface. The authors also references previous studies related to the goals of advancing from tools to teammates as studies by well-known researchers in the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (RCTA) funded research project (i.e. Jentsch). The overall quality of the references is sufficient with the exception that the authors cited Nielsen’s less recent article on usability engineering. Jakob Nielsen updated his usability heuristics in 1995 and I know the authors referenced his 1993 material. 
 
#### Reproducibility
If given the opportunity to reproduce their research experiment, I would find this study design to be obtainable. I would be interested in reproducing this experiment with regards to the recommendations provided from their research results. I believe this study can be duplicated and to further this research endeavor implementing these recommendations can provide further insight on human-robot teams and the effective methods that can be used to improve communication. 

#### Rating

I gave this research study a 4 out of 5 rating.

#### Explanation of Rating

I rated this specific research paper a 4 out of 5 because as it does provide tables with examples of the two types of questionnaires. The research study did not include more foundation background on Nielsen. I feel that this research paper may benefit from including Nielsen’s usability heuristics. By including Nielsen’s usability heuristics that may provide better reasoning for why it is important to take into consideration usability design for multimodal interfaces.
