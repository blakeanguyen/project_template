## General Introduction
In human-robot teams, there is a significant amount of research regarding human-robot interactions and situation awareness (SA). The communication interaction between the human operator and automation has been studied in various aspects as well. Previous research studies has explored human-robot interactions (HRI), situation awareness amongst human-robot teams, and adaptive automation. For example, in human-robot teams, the use of a handheld interface has been implemented to help facilitate the communication between the human operator and the robotic teammate. With the use of a handheld interface, researchers were able to investigate how SA is developed and maintained, and investigate the potential aspects that effect SA. In our research study, we are interested in investigating what adaptive automation looks like as a user interface (handheld device) with respect to usability guidelines. We are also interested in investigating what design approaches or methods are available (i.e., Nielsen’s usability heuristics) to use with adaptive automation to improve human-robot interactions, human-robot teams, and SA.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The research problem regarding human-robot teams originates from previous research that looked into human-human teams and team performance. From this, research advancements extended to conclude human-robot teams as there is competing mental models for both human operators and automation. Previous research has looked into information sharing that may foster SA in human-human teams and human-robot teams. Recent studies have investigated the use of a multimodal interface to facilitate the communication exchange between humans and robots in team missions. With the understanding that communication between humans and automation is a complex, investigation as to whether or not designing an interface for adaptive automation can facilitate SA in human-robot interactions.
