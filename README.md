> * Project Title: Situation Awareness (SA) and Usability in Human-Robot Teams

## General Introduction
In human-robot teams, there is a significant amount of research regarding human-robot interactions and situation awareness (SA). The communication interaction between the human operator and autonmation has been studied in various aspects as well. Previous research studies has explored human-robot interactions (HRI), situation awareness amongst human-robot teams, and adaptive automation. For example, in human-robot teams, the use of a handheld interface has been implements to facilitate the communication between the human operator and the robotic teammate. With the use of a handheld interface, researchers were able to research how SA is developed and maintained, as well as  aspects that effect SA. In our research study, we are intersted in investigating what adaptive automation looks like as a user interface (handheld device). We are also intersted in investigating what design approaches or methods are available to use with adaptive automation to improve human-robot interactions, human-robot teams, and SA.
